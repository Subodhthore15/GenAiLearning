The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3].

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), withxi,zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'),\n",

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] withβ1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5,step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.'),\n",

We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence.

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2).

      "The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" proposes a new neural network architecture called the Transformer, which uses only attention mechanisms to perform sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation.

      "\n",
      "The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduces the Transformer, a neural network architecture that revolutionizes sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation, by relying solely on attention mechanisms. Unlike traditional recurrent models, the Transformer eliminates the need for recurrence and convolutional layers, making it more parallelizable and faster to train. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on two machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming existing models in terms of quality and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer's architecture is composed of an encoder and decoder, both consisting of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected feed-forward networks. The encoder is composed of six identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple, position-wise feed-forward network. The decoder follows a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, generating symbols one element at a time, and consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer's attention mechanism is further detailed, with the output of each attention head being concatenated and projected to produce the final output values. Multi-Head Attention enables the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, allowing for more nuanced understanding of the input sequence. The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: encoder-decoder attention, self-attention in the encoder, and self-attention in the decoder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors also provide additional details on the feed-forward network (FFN) used in the Transformer, which consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The FFN is used in each layer of the encoder and decoder. The Transformer also uses learned embeddings to convert input and output tokens to vectors, as well as a learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper introduces positional encoding, a technique used to inject information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. This is done by adding positional encodings to the input embeddings, which allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions. The authors also experimented with using learned positional embeddings and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors highlight the benefits of self-attention layers, which connect all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, making them faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length is smaller than the representation dimensionality. This is particularly important for sequence transduction tasks, where learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also discusses the limitations of traditional approaches, such as convolutional layers, which require a stack of layers to connect all pairs of input and output positions, increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. In contrast, the Transformer's self-attention layers are more efficient and can learn to perform different tasks and exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors trained the models on two machine translation tasks, using the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets, and achieved a BLEU score of 28.4 on the English-to-German translation task and 41.0 on the English-to-French translation task, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score. The authors also experimented with different training regimes, including the use of Adam optimizer, residual dropout, and regularization, and found that the Transformer's innovative architecture and attention mechanisms enable efficient computation of representations of input and output sequences without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution, leading to state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional insights are provided through the analysis of model variations, including the impact of attention key size, model size, and dropout on model quality. The results demonstrate that the Transformer's architecture is robust and can be improved by adjusting these hyperparameters. Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of sequence transduction, and the Transformer has since become a widely used and influential model in many natural language processing tasks.\n",

       "'Based on the provided summary and the additional context, I refined the summary to provide a more comprehensive overview of the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" and its impact.\\n\\nThe paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduces the Transformer, a neural network architecture that revolutionizes sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation, by relying solely on attention mechanisms. Unlike traditional recurrent models, the Transformer eliminates the need for recurrence and convolutional layers, making it more parallelizable and faster to train. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on two machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming existing models in terms of quality and efficiency.\\n\\nThe Transformer\\'s architecture is composed of an encoder and decoder, both consisting of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected feed-forward networks. The authors highlight the benefits of self-attention layers, which connect all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, making them faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length is smaller than the representation dimensionality.\\n\\nThe paper also introduces positional encoding, a technique used to inject information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. The authors experimented with using learned positional embeddings and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results.\\n\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: encoder-decoder attention, self-attention in the encoder, and self-attention in the decoder. The output of each attention head is concatenated and projected to produce the final output values. The authors also provide additional details on the feed-forward network (FFN) used in the Transformer, which consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\n\\nThe paper demonstrates the Transformer\\'s ability to outperform even all previously reported ensembles on machine translation tasks. The authors also highlight the potential of the Transformer to be applied to other tasks and modalities, such as images, audio, and video. Moreover, they plan to extend the Transformer to handle large inputs and outputs and make generation less sequential.\\n\\nThe authors acknowledge the influence of several previous works, including layer normalization, neural machine translation, massive exploration of neural machine translation architectures, long short-term memory-networks, and deep residual learning. Additionally, they mention the challenges of learning long-term dependencies in recurrent neural networks and the importance of exploring new architectures.\\n\\nThe additional context provides further insights into the Transformer\\'s architecture and its impact on the field of sequence transduction. The authors cite several relevant papers, including \"Exploring the limits of language modeling\" [13], \"Neural GPUs learn algorithms\" [14], and \"Neural machine translation in linear time\" [15], which highlight the Transformer\\'s ability to handle long-range dependencies and its potential applications in other domains.\\n\\nThe paper also references several other works that have built upon the Transformer architecture, including [21-31], which demonstrate the Transformer\\'s ability to be applied to other tasks and modalities, such as abstractive summarization, language modeling, and computer vision. Specifically, [31] showcases Google\\'s neural machine translation system, which uses the Transformer architecture, and [32] presents deep recurrent models with fast-forward connections for neural machine translation, further emphasizing the Transformer\\'s impact on the field.\\n\\nOverall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of sequence transduction, and the Transformer has since become a widely used and influential model in many natural language processing tasks.'"
